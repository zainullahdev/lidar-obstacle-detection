Meets Specifications
Well done with the code. Onto the next one!

Compiling and Testing
The project code must compile without errors using cmake and make.

Builds.

Obstacle Detection
Bounding boxes enclose vehicles, and the pole on the right side of the vehicle. There is one box per detected object.

Boxes enclose vehicles as expected.

Most bounding boxes can be followed through the lidar stream, and major objects don't lose or gain bounding boxes in the middle of the lidar stream.

The code used for segmentation uses the 3D RANSAC algorithm developed in the course lesson.

Correctly implemented.

The code used for clustering uses the Euclidean clustering algorithm along with the KD-Tree developed in the course lesson.

Correctly implemented.

Code Efficiency
Your code does not need to sacrifice comprehension, stability, or robustness for speed. However, you should maintain good and efficient coding practices when writing your functions.

Here are some things to avoid. This is not a complete list, but there are a few examples of inefficiencies.

Running the exact same calculation repeatedly when you can run it once, store the value and then reuse the value later.
Loops that run too many times.
Creating unnecessarily complex data structures when simpler structures work equivalently.
Unnecessary control flow checks.
Runs relatively smooth. Can be improved in speed by sorting all PCL data points such that root is at the median value.
